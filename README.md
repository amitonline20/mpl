# Project Setup

## 1. Install Oracle Instant Client
- Download and install **instantclient_23_8** in the `C:\` drive.  
- If you don’t have it, ask a fellow developer who already has a working copy to share.

## 2. Update Environment Variables
- Add the Instant Client folder path to your system’s `PATH` environment variable.

## 3. Clone and Install Dependencies
```bash
git clone <repo_url>
cd <repo_name>
npm install
4. Database Configuration
Request the dbconfig file from a fellow developer where it is already working.

Place the file in the project root directory.

node index.js
